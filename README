This is a BZR plugin for play framework, just build the framework after pull
*run the ant script every time updating your play repository*

HOW TO :

cd ~/.bazaar/plugins
create this directory if it not exists
git clone git@github.com:waxzce/BZR-plugin-for-play-framework.git playbzr
!! your directory name does not contains any "-"
now you can check if the plugin is here by 
bzr plugins
